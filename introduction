This is my personal note when learning dynamic programming.
Dynamic programming:It's method that could through combining subproblems(optimal substructure) to sovle optimization problem.
We can recursively solve some optimal substructures (usually top-down) or make state transition directly from bottom to top.
But the former is very inefficient,both time and space.Because it solves many subproblems repeatedly.
